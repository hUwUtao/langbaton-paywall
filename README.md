# LangBatOn Experimental Donation Website 

Because the server isn't funded anymore. I decided to public the source code, and soon be used somewhere. Have fun

## Features

- Using a heavy materialui frontend framework
- A functional exchange card calculation and promotion calculated (also add bonuses for non-fee providers)
- A functional api obfuscation :troll:
- Is that a Bun app? IT MUST BE BLAZINGLY FAST

## Why

- It won't work (because there is no payment vendor yet!)
- Why do I named the encryption module `boost`?
- The client chonky asf

## License

Project license under `WTFPL` license. Yet no production data being used (except the encryption key hehe)
